# The Assignment

The assignment was to make your own portfolio/site so people could see who you are.


# What I did
I made a simple site that i'm going to change in the future.
I wanted to test out some css code like:
```
@keyframes{

}

```
# What I intend to do
I will continue to update this site with new things as I start to learn and understand more.
